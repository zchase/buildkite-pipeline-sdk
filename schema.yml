      skip:

        description: |
          Whether to skip this step or not. Passing a string (with a 70-character limit) provides a reason for skipping this command. Passing an empty string is equivalent to false. Note: Skipped steps will be hidden in the pipeline view by default, but can be made visible by toggling the 'Skipped jobs' icon.
